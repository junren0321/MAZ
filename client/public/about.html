        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Welcome to MAZ—an enchanting realm where PicBook enthusiasts can share, connect, and explore.</p>
        <p>In the whimsical world of MAZ, we see ourselves as wizards, conjuring a magical space dedicated to the love of PicBooks. Here, you are invited to embark on a journey through MAZ world, discovering hidden gems and meeting fellow explorers who share your passion.</p>
        <h2>The Concept</h2>
        <p>PicBooks might be a niche interest, but within this maze, they become a boundless adventure. The name "MAZ" is a playful nod to this exploration, drawing inspiration from the phonetic resemblance between "z" and "gic" in Taiwan, symbolizing the magic of discovering new stories and connections.</p>
        <h2>Our Journey</h2>
        <p>MAZ began as a course project—a labor of love crafted by a group of dedicated students. With limited time and resources, and for many of us, it was our first foray into the instance of project development. We faced numerous challenges, from WEBAPP to GitHub, but each obstacle was an opportunity for growth.</p>
        <p>Despite the hurdles, we have come a long way and have learned immensely throughout this journey. While we aimed for higher aspirations, the process itself has been a treasure trove of experiences and learning.</p>
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Our mission is to create a vibrant community where PicBook enthusiasts can feel at home. We aim to foster meaningful interactions, promote the art of PicBooks, and celebrate the joy they bring to our lives.</p>
        <p>Thank you for joining us on this magical journey. We hope you enjoy exploring MAZ as much as we enjoyed creating it.</p>
        <br><p>Sincerely,</p>
        <a href="./contact.html" style="font-weight: 600;">The MAZ Team</a>
